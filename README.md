# Lush Night
Just a simple and clean theme for VS Code that I use for my editors.


I don't plan n ofcially releasing this theme as an extention so if you would
like to use this theme it will have to be manually installed. You can do that by
cloning the repo into you `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` directory. It can then be
loaded like any other theme.

**Enjoy!**
